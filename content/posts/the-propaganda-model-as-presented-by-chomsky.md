# A Note

This article covers the work of Noam Chomsky, who is a renowned Western academic and an anarcho-syndicalist. While his work here is praiseworthy, he holds many other views that are deeply problematic from an Islamic perspective. Keep this in mind if you decide to read his books.

# Introduction 

It is generally known within the Muslim community that the mainstream media is nothing more than a propaganda arm of the establishment. Unfortunately, however, the community remains unaware of the true scope of the problem. This article aims to rectify that by explaining the propaganda model put forth by Edward. S. Herman and Noam Chomsky in *Manufacturing Consent: The Political economy of the Mass Media*, with some slight modifications to make it more relevant to us as Muslims. I have found this model to be more than satisfactory in my own experience. 

The propaganda model centers on five of what the authors call "filters". These are:

1. The size, ownership, and profit-orientation of the mass media. 
2. Advertising as the primary revenue source.
3. The mass media's reliance on the very institutions that it should be holding to account for information.
4. "Flak", which is used by the government in some underhanded ways when the media steps out of line. 
5. "Anticommunism" as a national religion and control mechanism.
  * This one is less relevant today, and I view it as a result of Chomsky's syndicalist beliefs. We will be replacing this "filter" with something more relevant to the Muslim community later in this article.

# Ownership

This is something that the Muslim community is largely aware of, so this section will be brief.
