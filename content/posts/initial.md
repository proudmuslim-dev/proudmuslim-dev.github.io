# About

The purpose of this website will be to disseminate information I consider "useful". This will primarily come in the form of blog posts covering whatever comes to mind, and there will be no set schedule for these posts. 

# <a name="why"></a> 

# Why?

The following verse from "ہندی اسلام" by Allama Iqbal encapsulates it. 

> ملا کو جو ہے ہند میں سجدے کی اجازت 
>
> نادان یہ سمجتا ہے کے اسلام ہے آزاد 

# <a name="topics"></a>

# What exactly will be covered?

While there is no strict set of topics that this website will be limited to, there is a broad range of topics that I hope to cover. A list of these can be found below.

* Digital privacy & mass surveillance
* Technology, its ramifications, and the choices we should make in light of these
* Important yet largely unknown figures
* Books that are crucial to any young Muslim's worldview

I may also cover the secular mind and its inconsistencies if the opportunity presents itself.
